# City Schools Analysis
Completed by Daniel Stephens

## About this project
This is an analysis of standardized math and reading test scores for high school students across a fictional city school system to determine what, if any, impact school type, class size, or budget may have on these scores.

The project is written in Python, utilizing Pandas libraries and was completed using Jupyter Notebook. 

## Accessing resources for this project

Since this project was completed in Jupyter Notebook, it is not necessary to download and run the scripts to view the output and analysis as the notebook with outputs can be viewed in GitHub. The completed notebook can be accessed in the [PyCitySchools](PyCitySchools) folder. 

If planning to test the scripts please download the entire folder to retain the path to resource files.
